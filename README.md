# perl-snippets

I began using Perl a few months back. I work as a Customer Support Manager so I have no prior experience in any programming langage - apart from what was taught in the school.

All my knowledge of Perl is through StackExchange, PerlMonks, PerlDocs and other similar sources. As part of my Perl "education" I've learnt a few things that weren't very obvious in the beginning. I want to share these things here.

This project will be a collection of small snippets of code that you can use. All scripts include documentation, but if anything isn't clear then let me know.
